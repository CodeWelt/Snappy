<b>Snappy v1.0 MacOSX</b>

Snappy is a free screenshot application built for MacOSX that allows you to easily take continuous snapshots of each visible desktop window.

By just a single click, screenshots of all windows shown by the desktop will be saved to a specified directory. Snappy is able to run in the background and continuously take snapshots of either all or just one of the visible windows. This feature enables you to constantly grab single frames of windows while you use them, regardless if they overlap.

Using progressional filenames the captured and stored images can be imported quickly to your favorite video-editing software. The video-software will combine all stored frames to a live screencast of any recorded window. An advanced feature will notice if window-content changed and prioritize its capture procedure for simultaneous storage.

// If you run the latest MacOSX Lion operating system and face permission errors, please run the following command from a terminal at your download directory:
